# **Development**
Run and deploy your Next.Js 15 + Payload CMS 3 portfolio.

## **Running Locally**

Create a `.env.local` file similar to [`.env.example`](.env.example).

Then install dependencies and run the development server:

```sh-session
npm install
npm run dev
```

## **Adjusting the content**

Create a database and S3, locally or in the cloud, e.g. on Supabase. Add the configuration to you `.env.local`.

Change the content in the locally running CMS, under [http://localhost:3000/admin](http://localhost:3000/admin)

When using Vercel, you can also add a Supabase integration and the database will be setup out of the box.
